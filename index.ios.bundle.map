It works exactly the same as it\n * would on a native app using `UINavigationController`, providing the same\n * animations and behavior from UIKit.\n *\n * As the name implies, it is only available on iOS. Take a look at\n * [`React Navigation`](https://reactnavigation.org/) for a cross-platform\n * solution in JavaScript, or check out either of these components for native\n * solutions: [native-navigation](http://airbnb.io/native-navigation/),\n * [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation).\n *\n * To set up the navigator, provide the `initialRoute` prop with a route\n * object. A route object is used to describe each scene that your app\n * navigates to. `initialRoute` represents the first route in your navigator.\n *\n * ```\n * import PropTypes from 'prop-types';\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { NavigatorIOS, Text } from 'react-native';\n *\n * export default class NavigatorIOSApp extends Component {\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <NavigatorIOS\n *         initialRoute={{\n *           component: MyScene,\n *           title: 'My Initial Scene',\n *         }}\n *         style={{flex: 1}}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * class MyScene extends Component {\n *   static propTypes = {\n *     title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n *     navigator: PropTypes.object.isRequired,\n *   }\n *\n *   _onForward = () => {\n *     this.props.navigator.push({\n *       title: 'Scene ' + nextIndex,\n *     });\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <View>\n *         <Text>Current Scene: { this.props.title }</Text>\n *         <TouchableHighlight onPress={this._onForward}>\n *           <Text>Tap me to load the next scene</Text>\n *         </TouchableHighlight>\n *       </View>\n *     )\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * In this code, the navigator renders the component specified in initialRoute,\n * which in this case is `MyScene`. This component will receive a `route` prop\n * and a `navigator` prop representing the navigator. The navigator's navigation\n * bar will render the title for the current scene, \"My Initial Scene\".\n *\n * You can optionally pass in a `passProps` property to your `initialRoute`.\n * `NavigatorIOS` passes this in as props to the rendered component:\n *\n * ```\n * initialRoute={{\n *   component: MyScene,\n *   title: 'My Initial Scene',\n *   passProps: { myProp: 'foo' }\n * }}\n * ```\n *\n * You can then access the props passed in via `{this.props.myProp}`.\n *\n * #### Handling Navigation\n *\n * To trigger navigation functionality such as pushing or popping a view, you\n * have access to a `navigator` object. The object is passed in as a prop to any\n * component that is rendered by `NavigatorIOS`. You can then call the\n * relevant methods to perform the navigation action you need:\n *\n * ```\n * class MyView extends Component {\n *   _handleBackPress() {\n *     this.props.navigator.pop();\n *   }\n *\n *   _handleNextPress(nextRoute) {\n *     this.props.navigator.push(nextRoute);\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     const nextRoute = {\n *       component: MyView,\n *       title: 'Bar That',\n *       passProps: { myProp: 'bar' }\n *     };\n *     return(\n *       <TouchableHighlight onPress={() => this._handleNextPress(nextRoute)}>\n *         <Text style={{marginTop: 200, alignSelf: 'center'}}>\n *           See you on the other nav {this.props.myProp}!\n *         </Text>\n *       </TouchableHighlight>\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * You can also trigger navigator functionality from the `NavigatorIOS`\n * component:\n *\n * ```\n * class NavvyIOS extends Component {\n *   _handleNavigationRequest() {\n *     this.refs.nav.push({\n *       component: MyView,\n *       title: 'Genius',\n *       passProps: { myProp: 'genius' },\n *     });\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <NavigatorIOS\n *         ref='nav'\n *         initialRoute={{\n *           component: MyView,\n *           title: 'Foo This',\n *           passProps: { myProp: 'foo' },\n *           rightButtonTitle: 'Add',\n *           onRightButtonPress: () => this._handleNavigationRequest(),\n *         }}\n *         style={{flex: 1}}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The code above adds a `_handleNavigationRequest` private method that is\n * invoked from the `NavigatorIOS` component when the right navigation bar item\n * is pressed. To get access to the navigator functionality, a reference to it\n * is saved in the `ref` prop and later referenced to push a new scene into the\n * navigation stack.\n *\n * #### Navigation Bar Configuration\n *\n * Props passed to `NavigatorIOS` will set the default configuration\n * for the navigation bar. Props passed as properties to a route object will set\n * the configuration for that route's navigation bar, overriding any props\n * passed to the `NavigatorIOS` component.\n *\n * ```\n * _handleNavigationRequest() {\n *   this.refs.nav.push({\n *     //...\n *     passProps: { myProp: 'genius' },\n *     barTintColor: '#996699',\n *   });\n * }\n *\n * render() {\n *   return (\n *     <NavigatorIOS\n *       //...\n *       style={{flex: 1}}\n *       barTintColor='#ffffcc'\n *     />\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * In the example above the navigation bar color is changed when the new route\n * is pushed.\n *\n */\nconst NavigatorIOS = createReactClass({\n  displayName: 'NavigatorIOS',\n\n  propTypes: {\n\n    /**\n     * NavigatorIOS uses `route` objects to identify child views, their props,\n     * and navigation bar configuration.

Integrate with your platform specific scroll\n * views, or even your custom built (every-frame animating) scroll views so that\n * all of these systems play well with the `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n *\n * iOS scroll event timing nuances:\n * ===============================\n *\n *\n * Scrolling without bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... physical touch starts ...\n * 2. `onTouchStartCapture`   (when you press down to stop the scroll)\n * 3. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 4. `onResponderRelease`    (when lifting up - you could pause forever before * lifting)\n * 5. `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n *\n *\n * Scrolling with bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... bounce begins ...\n *    ... some time elapses ...\n *    ... physical touch during bounce ...\n * 2. `onMomentumScrollEnd`   (Makes no sense why this occurs first during bounce)\n * 3. `onTouchStartCapture`   (immediately after `onMomentumScrollEnd`)\n * 4. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 5. `onTouchEnd`            (You could hold the touch start for a long time)\n * 6. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (When releasing the view starts bouncing back)\n *\n * So when we receive an `onTouchStart`, how can we tell if we are touching\n * *during* an animation (which then causes the animation to stop)? The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the\n * keyboard could be dismissed.\n *\n *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillHide\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidHide\n */\n\nconst IS_ANIMATING_TOUCH_START_THRESHOLD_MS = 16;\n\ntype State = {\n    isTouching: boolean,\n    lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: number,\n    lastMomentumScrollEndTime: number,\n    observedScrollSinceBecomingResponder: boolean,\n    becameResponderWhileAnimating: boolean,\n};\ntype Event = Object;\n\nfunction isTagInstanceOfTextInput(tag) {\n  const instance = getInstanceFromNode(tag);\n  return instance && instance.viewConfig && (\n    instance.viewConfig.uiViewClassName === 'AndroidTextInput' ||\n    instance.viewConfig.uiViewClassName === 'RCTMultilineTextInputView' ||\n    instance.viewConfig.uiViewClassName === 'RCTSinglelineTextInputView'\n  );\n}\n\nconst ScrollResponderMixin = {\n  mixins: [Subscribable.Mixin],\n  scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState: function(): State {\n    return {\n      isTouching: false,\n      lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: 0,\n      lastMomentumScrollEndTime: 0,\n\n      // Reset to false every time becomes responder.

Props provide configurability for several features, such as\n * auto-correction, auto-capitalization, placeholder text, and different keyboard\n * types, such as a numeric keypad.\n *\n * The simplest use case is to plop down a `TextInput` and subscribe to the\n * `onChangeText` events to read the user input. There are also other events,\n * such as `onSubmitEditing` and `onFocus` that can be subscribed to. A simple\n * example:\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n *\n * export default class UselessTextInput extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props);\n *     this.state = { text: 'Useless Placeholder' };\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <TextInput\n *         style={{height: 40, borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1}}\n *         onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n *         value={this.state.text}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // skip this line if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => UselessTextInput);\n * ```\n *\n * Two methods exposed via the native element are .focus() and .blur() that\n * will focus or blur the TextInput programmatically.\n *\n * Note that some props are only available with `multiline={true/false}`.\n * Additionally, border styles that apply to only one side of the element\n * (e.g., `borderBottomColor`, `borderLeftWidth`, etc.) will not be applied if\n * `multiline=false`. To achieve the same effect, you can wrap your `TextInput`\n * in a `View`:\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, View, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n *\n * class UselessTextInput extends Component {\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <TextInput\n *         {...this.props} // Inherit any props passed to it; e.g., multiline, numberOfLines below\n *         editable = {true}\n *         maxLength = {40}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * export default class UselessTextInputMultiline extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props);\n *     this.state = {\n *       text: 'Useless Multiline Placeholder',\n *     };\n *   }\n *\n *   // If you type something in the text box that is a color, the background will change to that\n *   // color.\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *      <View style={{\n *        backgroundColor: this.state.text,\n *        borderBottomColor: '#000000',\n *        borderBottomWidth: 1 }}\n *      >\n *        <UselessTextInput\n *          multiline = {true}\n *          numberOfLines = {4}\n *          onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n *          value={this.state.text}\n *        />\n *      </View>\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // skip these lines if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent(\n *  'AwesomeProject',\n *  () => UselessTextInputMultiline\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * `TextInput` has by default a border at the bottom of its view.

It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <View\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <View>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </View>\n *     </View>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function()

This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n * Also inherits [ScrollView Props](docs/scrollview.html#props), unless it is nested in another FlatList of same orientation.\n */\nclass FlatList<ItemT> extends React.PureComponent<Props<ItemT>, void> {\n  static defaultProps: DefaultProps = defaultProps;\n  props: Props<ItemT>;\n  /**\n   * Scrolls to the end of the content.

Check out this\n * [blog post](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/better-list-views.html)\n * for more details.\n *\n * ListView - A core component designed for efficient display of vertically\n * scrolling lists of changing data. The minimal API is to create a\n * [`ListView.DataSource`](docs/listviewdatasource.html), populate it with a simple\n * array of data blobs, and instantiate a `ListView` component with that data\n * source and a `renderRow` callback which takes a blob from the data array and\n * returns a renderable component.\n *\n * Minimal example:\n *\n * ```\n * class MyComponent extends Component {\n *   constructor() {\n *     super();\n *     const ds = new ListView.DataSource({rowHasChanged: (r1, r2) => r1 !== r2});\n *     this.state = {\n *       dataSource: ds.cloneWithRows(['row 1', 'row 2']),\n *     };\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <ListView\n *         dataSource={this.state.dataSource}\n *         renderRow={(rowData) => <Text>{rowData}</Text>}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ListView also supports more advanced features, including sections with sticky\n * section headers, header and footer support, callbacks on reaching the end of\n * the available data (`onEndReached`) and on the set of rows that are visible\n * in the device viewport change (`onChangeVisibleRows`), and several\n * performance optimizations.\n *\n * There are a few performance operations designed to make ListView scroll\n * smoothly while dynamically loading potentially very large (or conceptually\n * infinite) data sets:\n *\n *  * Only re-render changed rows - the rowHasChanged function provided to the\n *    data source tells the ListView if it needs to re-render a row because the\n *    source data has changed - see ListViewDataSource for more details.\n *\n *  * Rate-limited row rendering - By default, only one row is rendered per\n *    event-loop (customizable with the `pageSize` prop). This breaks up the\n *    work into smaller chunks to reduce the chance of dropping frames while\n *    rendering rows.\n */\n\nvar ListView = createReactClass({\n  displayName: 'ListView',\n  _childFrames: ([]: Array<Object>),\n  _sentEndForContentLength: (null: ?number),\n  _scrollComponent: (null: any),\n  _prevRenderedRowsCount: 0,\n  _visibleRows: ({}: Object),\n  scrollProperties: ({}: Object),\n\n  mixins: [ScrollResponder.Mixin, TimerMixin],\n\n  statics: {\n    DataSource: ListViewDataSource,\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * You must provide a renderRow function.

Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n */\nclass VirtualizedList extends React.PureComponent<Props, State> {\n  props: Props;\n\n  // scrollToEnd may be janky without getItemLayout prop\n  scrollToEnd(params?: ?{animated?: ?boolean}) {\n    const animated = params ? params.animated : true;\n    const veryLast = this.props.getItemCount(this.props.data) - 1;\n    const frame = this._getFrameMetricsApprox(veryLast);\n    const offset = Math.max(\n      0,\n      frame.offset +\n        frame.length +\n        this._footerLength -\n        this._scrollMetrics.visibleLength,\n    );\n    /* $FlowFixMe(>=0.53.0 site=react_native_fb,react_native_oss) This comment\n     * suppresses an error when upgrading Flow's support for React.

Having even one rounding error is deadly because a one\n * pixel border may vanish or be twice as big.\n *\n * In React Native, everything in JavaScript and within the layout engine works\n * with arbitrary precision numbers. It's only when we set the position and\n * dimensions of the native element on the main thread that we round. Also,\n * rounding is done relative to the root rather than the parent, again to avoid\n * accumulating rounding errors.\n *\n */\nclass PixelRatio {\n  /**\n   * Returns the device pixel density.
